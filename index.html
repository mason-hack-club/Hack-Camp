                We'll be taking you through a course where you learn to create
                your very own website. After that, you'll have the opportunity
                to split into groups and design a website to market a product!
                We'll be including fun, non-coding activities to keep you
                moving.

                Hack Camp's organizers are truly passionate about STEM
                education. Our goal as leads is to expose students to as much
                computer science as possible. We also see results. Out of the
                Hack Camp 2017 students surveyed:<br />

              <p>
                Hack Camp has two main sessions: morning and afternoon. When
                registering, simply choose if you want the morning
                (9:00am-12:30pm) or afternoon (1:30pm-5:00pm) time. The
                curriculum will not vary between timeslots &mdash; we still have
                both beginner and advanced sessions.

                Hack Camp 2019 is for students of Mason City Schools!
                Specifically, we're looking for incoming 6<sup>th</sup> graders
                to incoming 9<sup>th</sup> graders. If you don't meet the
                requirements, but are still interested, feel free to email us at

              <h3 class="center">Do I Need to Know How to Code?</h3>
              <p>
                No! We know that coding can be a broad subject, and some people
                may be hesitant to jump in. However, Hack Camp's goal is to
                introduce and explain programming in an easy-to-understand way!
                That means that you don't need to bring any programming
                experience to the tableâ€”just a willingness to learn! For those
                of you who attended Hack Camp 2018, or for those who have
                experience in programming, we also have an advanced track.

              <h3 class="center">What Should I Bring?</h3>
              <p>
                The only thing you need is a laptop & charger. Your
                school-issued Chromebooks will work great.

                to you during breaks. We also have an awesome swag bag for you,
